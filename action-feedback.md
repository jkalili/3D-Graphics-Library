| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Sandbox scene | Sandbox scene is provided and functional | 10/10 |
| | **_pitch.md_** | |
| • Use case | Final scene is nicely described 👽 | 3/3 |
| • Animation | Autonomous animation(s) are stated | 3/3 |
| • Interaction | Interactions are stated | 3/3 |
| | **Autonomous animation** | |
| • Use case | Autonomous animation fits the use case | 4/4 |
| • Starter code difference | Autonomous animation differs from starter code |  |
| • Implementation | No serious animation implementation issues seen | 8/8 |
| | **Interaction** | |
| • Use case | Interaction fits the use case | 4/4 |
| • Starter code difference | Interaction differs from starter code |  |
| • Implementation | No serious interaction implementation issues seen | 8/8 |
| | **Lighting** | |
| • Use case | Lighting choices fit the use case | 4/4 |
| • Implementation | The lighting feedback from the previous assignment still applies but we won’t re-deduct those. If you eventually fix them I think you’ll find the lighting behavior to feel more consistent | 8/8 |
| | **Technical milestones** | |
| • Camera | Camera motion is not implemented by the pitched scene—it doesn’t matter here whether the library can do it; you have to _show_ the library doing it (–7) | 0/7 |
| • Wireframe/solid | Wireframe and solid rendering appear to change as intended | 7/7 |
| • Projection | Changing of projection matrices is not implemented by the pitched scene—it doesn’t matter here whether the library can do it; you have to _show_ the library doing it (–7) | 0/7 |
| • Aspect ratio | The canvas aspect ratio isn’t square but the viewport is forced to be—remember the instructions said “aspect ratio matches that of both viewing volumes” (–5) | 2/7 |
| • Scene add/remove | Scene add/remove appears to work as intended—in the sandbox. This is supposed to be demonstrated in the pitched scene (–4) | 3/7 |
| • Group add/remove | Group add/remove appears to work as intended—in the sandbox, and that is for removal from a group only. This is supposed to be demonstrated in the pitched scene (–5) …higher deduction because even in the sandbox, only group removal is demonstrated | 2/7 |
| • Faceted/smooth | Without the capacity to use faceted normals, this feature is impossible to implement (–8) | 0/8 |
| _credits.md_ | _credits.md_ succinctly describes who did what | 10/10 |
| Custom instructions | Custom setup/installation instructions not necessary |  |
| _commentary.md_ | Commentary provides answers to all five questions, all at sufficient detail…individually answered by each member 😮 —the intent was for the group to answer the five questions _together_ but the individual perspectives do add some insight so 👌🏽 | 10/10 |
| _group-retrospective.md_ | _group-retrospective.md_ provides an itemized description of what each group member did throughout the last four assignments | 5/5 |
| Additional features |  |  |
| Code maintainability | Application does not run out of the box due to a capitalization error in Vector.js—perhaps it “worked out your machine,” but official semantics is that imports _are_ case-sensitive and this was already pointed out in feedback that was made available before the due date, so at the minimum should have been asked about somehow. The issue itself is easily fixable and because you were told about this with a few days’ notice, we will come down harder on the deduction this time (–5) | -5 |
| Code readability | No major code readability issues seen |  |
| Version control | Commit count appears commensurate with amount of work and messages are short but sufficiently descriptive |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit on 5/6 2:44pm |  |
| | **Total** | **89/130** |
