# The Parking Lot

## The full moon is rising and the stars are flying by. You're late for an evening meeting in a city you don't know where you are. You arrive in a parking lot filled with strange cars - one seems to even change colors. You pull into your spot a little too quickly and _bam_, you've hit a tree blowing in the wind which weirdly enough has both apples and oranges(haha 1st grade math teachers who told me you can't compare them). But everything may not be as bad as it seems because you haven't eaten yet, and luckily an apple falls from the tree! You get out the car and realize that other than the bus in the lot, there is nothing around you. A mysterious man driving this all terrain vehicle instructs you to get in. You do so, and the car is grabbed by a tractor beam! Aliens!

### Autonomous Animation:

Moon is constantly in rotation (separate rotation from rest of scene). The scene is also in a constant rotation to show the depth and detail of objects and composites as well as to show off our normals and lighting. The propeller on the back of the all terrain bus is also autonomously animated. The flying saucer is constantly phasing in and out of the visible spectrum; it is moving and its disk is rotating as well. The trees are also rustling in the wind!

### Interaction:

Our scene has multiple interactive buttons. The zoom zoom button triggers the sedan to honk and accelerate forwards, hitting a tree, and is unable to move past this tree. This causes an apple to fall from the tree. The button does nothing after it is already pressed, unless the refresh or reset buttons are pressed. To align with our pitch, the fly away button can only be pressed after the zoom zoom button is pressed. If the user pressed the fly away button before the zoom zoom button, they are prompted with an error. If the user presses fly away after the zoom zoom button, the bus will take off into the night sky. There is also a refresh button for convenience.
